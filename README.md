# Among Us Bot: Hard Tasks

## Execution
In order to execute this task, simply run ```python tasks.py``` and select the  number associated to the task being done. The values for this bot are hardcoded for an 800x600 window, so make sure the game is running in that resolution. The window should reside on the top-left corner of your screen so that the coordinates will still work. If you have multiple monitors, it should be top-left of the primary display.
